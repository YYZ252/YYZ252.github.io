<h3 id="cédric-colas---towards-social-autotelic-agents">Cédric Colas - “Towards Social Autotelic Agents”</h3>

<p>Cédric Colas is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Cognitive Science Lab at MIT and the Flowers Lab at INRIA. His PhD thesis introduced the concept of autotelic learning as a computational framework for endowing artificial agents with the ability to represent and pursue their own goals. Through the co-evolution of goal generation and goal achievement systems, autotelic learning makes the first steps towards a computational model of human’s ability to grow repertoires of skills throughout a lifetime. His current research interests include the examination of the role of social interactions in shaping the goal representations and goal reaching skills of artificial agents.</p>

<h3 id="meng-guo---hybrid-optimization-for-multi-agent-systems-with-expert-knowledge">Meng Guo - “Hybrid Optimization for Multi-agent Systems with Expert Knowledge”</h3>
