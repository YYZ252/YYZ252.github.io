## Call for papers

#### Important dates

- Workshop paper submission deadline: ~~28th April 2023 (AOE)~~
- Author notification: ~~12th May 2023~~
- Camera-ready: 24th May 2023
- Finalized workshop program: 25th May 2023
- Workshop date: **29<sup>th</sup> May 2023**
- Submission link: [https://easychair.org/cfp/L3H2](https://easychair.org/cfp/L3H2)


We invite extended abstract submissions of preliminary or ongoing work related to the topics of interest. These submissions can be:

- Traditional submissions presenting preliminary results of ongoing research (including negative results and open problems)
- Submissions linked to already published papers coming from A) Journal papers which have not had the chance to be discussed in a conference and B) Conference papers from other Robotics and Machine Learning conferences that are of high interest for our workshop.

All accepted abstracts will have the opportunity to be presented at the workshop during a spotlight talk and poster session. We also plan to invite some of the authors of accepted submissions to the junior panel, where current challenges, emerging topics and bluesky ideas will be discussed. This is a non-archival venue: there will be no formal proceedings, but we strongly encourage the authors to publish their extended abstracts on arXiv; links to the papers will be placed on the workshopâ€™s website and will remain available after the workshop. 

Submission format: We encourage participants to submit their research in the form of either a paper (6 pages maximum without references), or an extended abstract (2 pages maximum), both using the IEEE conference template. The submitted contributions will go through a single-blind review process.
